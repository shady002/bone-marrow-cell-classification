# Fine-Grained Classification of Bone Marrow Blood Cells

This project focuses on the fine-grained classification of 14 bone marrow blood cell types using deep learning techniques. We leverage both a convolutional neural network (ResNet-50) and a transformer-based architecture (Vision Transformer - ViT) for comparative analysis. The dataset is sourced from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA).

## üîç Problem Statement

Accurate classification of bone marrow blood cells is essential for diagnosing hematologic diseases such as leukemia and multiple myeloma. Manual microscopy is time-consuming and subject to human error. This project automates cell type classification using deep learning to support more reliable diagnostic decisions.

## üéØ Objective

To develop a deep learning model that classifies 14 types of bone marrow blood cells with high accuracy, improving the consistency and speed of hematological diagnoses.

## üìÅ Dataset

- **Source**: [TCIA Bone Marrow Cytomorphology Dataset](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/bone-marrow-cytomorphology_mll_helmholtz_fraunhofer/)
- **Extracted Classes**: 14 distinct cell types (e.g., ART, BLA, EBO, EOS, etc.)
- **Format**: JPEG images categorized in folders by class

## üß† Models Used

- **ResNet-50**: Fine-tuned on our dataset for baseline CNN performance
- **ViT (Vision Transformer)**: Pre-trained transformer model applied to medical imaging for improved attention-based feature extraction

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Image normalization
   - Data augmentation (train set)
   - 80/10/10 split for training, validation, testing

2. **Training**:
   - ResNet-50: Trained for 25 epochs with CrossEntropy loss and Adam optimizer
   - ViT: Fine-tuned with transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet weights

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
   - Confusion matrix visualization
   - Per-class metrics and error analysis

## üìä Results

| Model      | Test Accuracy |
|------------|---------------|
| ResNet-50  | 68.36%       |
| ViT        | 80.27%       |

- EOS, PEB, PLM showed higher F1-scores.
- Some classes like MMZ and MON showed class imbalance sensitivity.

## üñºÔ∏è Visualizations

- Confusion matrices
- Per-class predictions with correct/wrong color coding
- GradCAM-style attention maps (optional)
